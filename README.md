Sails of Liberty
================
Sails of Liberty (codename: project-sparrow) is a pirate-themed game implemented in Java and CouchDB. Developed by [Plexers](http://plexers.biz/), despite being part of a university project we hope that it will become a fully featured 3D game using JMonkey Game Engine.
